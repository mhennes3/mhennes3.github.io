                    <p>The first stage of this project was ideation and exploration. I was directed to pursue a handful of different directions for my animal, object or thing and its corresponding letter. I was initially inspired by the letter D and a dolphin. For my first iteration, I attempted to integrate the dolphin into the letterform itself. For the second, I used the dolphin to construct the negative space of the counter. In each, I supplemented the dolphin with splashing water and droplets. In critique, I was notified that the droplets looked like flames, the splash looked like a coral reef, and that the idea was ultimately unoriginal. I was advised to go a different direction with my animal + object.</p></div>

                    <p>During my second round of ideation, I decided to pursue two completely different ideas. The first was the letter S, with the planet Saturn and the sun forming the negative space encircled by the head and tail. My second idea was the letter B, with the arches as birds, and the spine as a flowering tree branch. Regarding the latter, I was advised to reduce the tension between the beaks of each bird, and the branches. It was also suggested to enhance the flowers on each branch. Despite these critiques, I was recommended to pursue the former concept, as my instructor hadn’t seen something done like it before. I was advised to choose a thicker font, and strengthen the integration between letterform and objects.</p></div>

                    <p>The next phase of the project was to develop four drastically different explorations of my chosen direction from the previous phase. I had opted to pursue the letter S and elements of outer space. I began this phase by searching for structurally-unique variations of the letter S. Starting to the right of my initial design and going clockwise, I tested fonts such as Coquette Black, PraterScriptPro, and Stenciletta Solid Bold. Upon reviewing these ideas, I was urged to find a way in which my objects might be better emphasized; viewers found my sun, Saturn, and stars to be small and visually insignificant. They did, however, prefer a bolder S, in contrast to my initial idea.</p></div>

                    <p>The image above was my final deliverable. I decided to swap the letter and background shades. as this allowed for the setting to be outer space, while I maintained the contrast of my letterform. I moved forward with Stenciletta Solid Bold as my font, however I used two symmetrical shooting stars as my counters. I made them much bigger than the sun and Saturn in my prior iteration, thus addressing the concern with visually insignificant objects. The final project fulfills the given requirements, while also presenting a clean and visually-appealing composition.</p></div>
