                    <p>In phase one, we were asked to create four variations of a visual composition using the aforementioned phrases. We were not allowed to use lines or shapes - unless they were an outcome of alignments - and/or colors - only black, white, and tonal grays. For my first and fourth compositions, I decided to emphasize the element 'fracturing'. In the first, the three lines of text are subtly disconnected and displaced by fine fractures. In the fourth, repeated phrases are fractured by one giant crack. My second composition also features the phrases repeated, however they are divided by the silhouettes of two faces - one black, one white - facing in opposite directions.  Finally, my third composition features the word 'racism' at the center, with the rest of the phrases spiraling out from it. This was meant to convey that racism is a root problem, and that larger problems (i.e. divisions and destroyed societies) stem from it. To note- my second and fourth ideas do not feature lines/shapes (per the instructions); rather, I cut and subtracted text from each line, to create the illusion of a shape.</p></div>

                    <p>During critique, my first and fourth ideas closely resembled others', and my third seemed too simple. I received a positive response to my second idea, and I was advised to go in that direction. In the second phase, we were encouraged to develop different variations of our idea. Again, we were instructed not to use lines/shapes or color. I decided to test my concept with a single silhouette rather than two, and to construct the face itself with text. Neither of these seemed particularly strong, and I was stuck at an impasse. I was unsure how to push my idea further.</p></div>

                    <p>The next critique was one-on-one with the instructor, to whom I brought my issue. She guided me to consider more potent symbols - symbols that would evoke the phrases' meaning. In other words, if a viewer didn't read the text itself, how might the message still be visually conveyed? I delved into research on symbols of racism stumbled upon the Nazi salute. I felt that this was a very strong visual, and I determined to make it the focal point of my concept going forward. During this phase, I developed two more compositions : one, of the hand itself, and the second of Hitler performing the salute. Both utilized the method of repeating type and cutting/subtracting to construct an image. Once again, I felt that I wasn't pushing the idea enough.</p></div>

                    <p>During the next class period, I showed my compositions to a friend. I mentioned that I wanted to create an eerie composition that evoked some discomfort and fear. Through conversation, we came to the idea of glitch-text. This tactic was used in some promotional posters for the horror film "The Purge", and it elicited the exact response that I wanted. Though not required, I decided to develop four more visual compositions. In the first, I attempted to simply 'glitch' the text. In the second I repeated the text, in order to make it appear like a glitched, looping/repeating TV screen or computer monitor. In the third, I took on of my previous ideas and reversed it (figure cut out of background text. I then repeated the third, but with the glitch-text.</p></div>

                    <p>In the next phase of the project, we were instructed to incorporate (no more than 3) color(s) to our solutions, while maintaining strong visual hierarchy. My instructor had informed me that my composition had the feel of propaganda, so I sought to evoke that in my first iteration. I used characteristic colors (red, white, black), type treatment (shadows), and spatial layouts of propaganda from the time of Hitler. I also attempted to fuse this concept with my idea of glitch text, hence the broken type. For my second iteration, I tried glitch text in another way - divergent cyans and magentas that create white text on screens.</p></div>

                    <p>At the final critique, I was informed that my first composition didn't look like propaganda, and that my second was a better direction to pursue. For my final project, I used a font that was more explicitly digital. I again separated the cyans and magentas, and then split certain lines of text and increased noise. I felt that this gave it the ultimate ‘glitch’ effect. To enhance the eerie feel of this piece, I also incorporated the figure of Hitler. I cut him from the text, like before. I was careful to fragment the figure along the same lines as glitched/noisy text. Overall, I’m proud of this piece and the many iterations that I went through to achieve it. </p></div>
