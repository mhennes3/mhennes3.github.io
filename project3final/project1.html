                    <p>The first phase of this project was to determine a topic, research and select an article, and consider which currently existing magazine(s) the article would appear in. I was currently taking a course on physical spaces of wellbeing, and decided to set this as my topic. I then found a related article titled "Home as a Healing Space: Decorating for Psychological Comfort" on the website Psychology Today. Although the article would be published in a scientific journal, I wanted my magazine to be a hybrid of architecture magazine and journal. We were next instructed to explore magazine layouts and sketch some simple ideas. I sketched both a traditional two-column and a three-column layout. I also began considering visual cues to reference my topic. Some early ideas were the images of a brain and face silhouette.</p></div>

                    <p>During the next phase, we were advised to begin more seriously developing 'visual hooks'. I tried to incorporate many different symbols of mental health and/or architecture in my sketches. Some of these symbols included brain scans, blueprints, patient files, and buildings integrated with text.</p></div>

                    <p>During critique, I received the most positive response to my sketch with both brain scans and blueprints. I was encouraged to find a way in which they might interact with one another, to reference the overlap of physical space and wellness. I returned to sketching, and developed multiple variations of my concept. In the first iteration, a blueprint is imposed upon the scan of a person in profile. In the second, multiple small scans fill a blueprint. In the third, a blueprint is imposed upon a top-down brain scan, and the image is split across two pages.  I also tried the third iteration (split-page) with the profile scan. Finally, I sketched a page upon which blueprints and brain scans are scattered.</p></div>

                    <p>The next phase was to begin transferring our content from sketches to digital. As the article was quite long, I decided to go with a three column layout. My first page features a profile brain scan; a blueprint is imposed on it, and carries onto the second page. The rest of the spreads are filled with other blueprints and images of scans. I decided to keep the spreads fairly neutral, as a scientific journal would be devoid of color. The colors that I did choose, however - a pale blue and yellow - are meant to evoke the content of the article. They are both calming and positive.</p></div>

                    <p>During the final critique, I was informed of some areas for improvement. The text was very dense, so I was encouraged to increase my leading. The quote on my third page was not properly formatted; I needed to switch to a hanging quote. Finally, the icons on my fourth page did not match the blueprints in style; I needed to use icons that were more fine-lined. I made all these changes, and I feel that the finished product is exactly what I had envisioned, if not better.</p></div>
